# Real-Estate-App
This is a full-stack Django web application.

Beyond the out-of-the-box feaures from Django and some CRUD functionality, the application also features a contact form and, more notably, code that can automate pulling emails from an inbox.

The current implementation of this feature is to track what users sent real estate inquiries from a known 3rd party (ex. BizBuySell), present it to the user on the web, and allow them to send a DocuSign NDA in one click.
